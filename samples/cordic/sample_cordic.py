HeteroCL Tutorial : CORDIC Design
=================================

**Author**: Yi-Hsiang Lai (seanlatias@github)

COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) is a method for calculating a variety of
functions including trigonometric and hyperbolic. The various functions are calculated
through an iterative set of vector rotations. At the end of these rotations, the value of
the function is easily determined from the (x, y) coordinate. A CORDIC is often used to
achieve low-cost multiplierless sine/cosine implementations in FPGA as well as ASIC
designs.

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to make use of the decoupled quantization schemes
and algorithms in HeteroCL. We also show how we can explore different quantization
schemes with the quantize API.
