imageLib is a small C++ library for 2D multi-band images.  See Image.h
for more detail.  Reading and writing of images is supported in png
and pgm/ppm formats, as well as a subset of Targa.  See ImageIO.h for
more detail.

This code is derived from a subset of the StereoMatcher code by Rick
Szeliski and Daniel Scharstein, which is available at
