- Version Identifier
- Random hash
- Board name
- Specifies if the kernel is a virtual fabric
- Specifies whether the kernel was built in big-endian mode
- Number of memory interfaces (DIMMS or banks) usable as device global memory
- Size of global memory allocated by program
- Number of kernels
  For each kernel:
  g - Kernel name
   - Start address of kernel control registers
   - Size of kernel control registers
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-group invariant (if the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to make local_size = global_size. This is an optimization so it is ignored in emulation.
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-item invariant (if the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to ensure that only a single thread is present on the device at a time. This is an optimization so it is ignored in emulation.
   - Number of times kernel operations are vectorized. The kernel will launched with fewer work-items in each work-groups as many times as the number of vector lanes.
   - number of words in this kernel's profile scan chain.
   - Number of kernel arguments
   For each kernel argument:
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
   For each kernel argument:
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
   For each kernel argument:
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
   - Number of printf calls
   - Number of local memory systems.
   - X-dim of required work-group size
   - Y-dim of required work-group size
   - Z-dim of required work-group size
   - Maximum work-group size
   - Maximum global work dimension
