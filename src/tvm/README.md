TVM: Tensor IR Stack for Deep Learning Systems
==============================================

TVM is a Tensor intermediate representation(IR) stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.
