      <!-- Setting IS_STALL_FREE="yes" means the function neither generates stalls internally nor can it 
           properly handle incoming stalls (because it simply ignores its stall/valid inputs). If set
           to "no", the function must properly handle stall/valid signals.

      <!-- If the function always takes known number of clock cycles (specified by EXPECTED_LATENCY)
           to compute its output, set IS_FIXED_LATENCY to "yes".
           Note that IS_FIXED_LATENCY could be "yes" while IS_STALL_FREE="no". Such a function would
           produce its output in fixed number of cycles but could still deal with stall signals 
           properly.  -->

      <!-- Expected latency of this function. If IS_FIXED_LATENCY="yes", this is the number of 
           pipeline stages inside the function. In this case, EXPECTED_LATENCY must be set exactly
           to the latency of the function, otherwise incorrect hardware will result.
           For variable latency functions, pipeline around this function will be balanced to this 
           value. Setting EXPECTED_LATENCY to a different value will still produce correct results
           but may affect number of stalls inside the pipeline. -->

           Otherwise, it is not required.
           If CAPACITY is strictly less than EXPECTED_LATENCY, the compiler will automatically 
           insert capacity-balancing FIFOs after this function when required. -->
